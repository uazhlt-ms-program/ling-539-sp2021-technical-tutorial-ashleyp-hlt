## Summary

In this assignment, you will develop an accessible technical tutorial in the form of a webpage (ex. [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)) for an NLP/HLT tool.

## Outcomes

- Demonstrate how to install and use an NLP tool
- Document software in a way that makes it more accessible to a general audience
- Create a small website to host your documentation
- Demonstrate how to evaluate an NLP tool

## Requirements
- Tutorial be in the form of a publicly accessible webpage
  - It's up to you to decide where to host it and how to develop it, though I recommend simply using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) with [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
- The software you select should be **open source**
- Identify the tool's **software license**
- Identify the **version** of the software that it targets
- Include a **reproducible walkthrough example** demonstrating how to use the the tool with "real" data
- Include a **simple evaluation** (ex. accuracy, speed, etc)  
  - This can be caculated against your sample data.


As you develop your proposal and tutorial, consider the following question ...

### _What is this tool used for?_

Identify some common uses of the tool and the problems it is trying to solve.

### _What natural languages does the tool support?_

Is this a tool specific to English?  Can it be adapted to another natural language?

### _Is there a similar tutorial out there already?_

Your tutorial should be **unique** (ex. different natural language and/or domain).

### _What makes this tool unique/different from similar offerings?_

Describe how this tool differs from others that are available.

### _Can I evaluate how well the tool performs on some data?_

Your tutorial should include a simple evaluation (ex. accuracy, speed, etc).  This can be caculated against your sample data.


## Where to find NLP tools

- System demonstrations from ACL conference proceedings
- LREC proceedings
- GitHub
- Extensions for popular libraries
- Explore webpages for NLP research labs at various institutions
- Annotation/data collection software
